 Next time you don't feel productive, keep in mind: "The software industry didnâ€™t increase productivity by demanding more from its engineers; instead, it developed a more productive system to organize their efforts." Great reading on productivity (also applied to software engineering)!

I guess revolution is not happening in Western countries. Read this article if you want to know why El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as an official currency.
A Salvadoran friend told me almost all of the historical background given in the article is true.
