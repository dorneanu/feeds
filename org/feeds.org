 Next time you don't feel productive, keep in mind: "The software industry didnâ€™t increase productivity by demanding more from its engineers; instead, it developed a more productive system to organize their efforts." Great reading on productivity (also applied to software engineering)!

:END:
I guess revolution is not happening in Western countries. Read this article if you want to know why El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as an official currency.
A Salvadoran friend told me almost all of the historical background given in the article is true.

:END:
This article combines ideas and best practices from gurus like Eric Evans (author of Domain-Driven Design), Martin Fowler, Rebecca Parons (author of Building Evolutionary Architectures). Although this article is almost 5 years old, the same principles still apply.

How to manage GPG keys in 2021. The author shows how to use sub-keys instead of master keys
for different contexts (work, personal, social media, SSH etc) and how to generate elliptic curves (Ed25519) which are way more secret than RSA.
** Tracking stolen crypto is a booming business                                :linkedin:

:END:
Seems that forensics in the crypto gets completely new dimensions. I wonder if AI/ML will have a huge impact on data analysis with regards to this topic.
